Shutil
------
It is a module in python is a part of Standard library an dis used for high-level file operations such as copying, moving, deleting and achieving files and directories. 

	shutil.copy(src, dst) -> copies a file
	shutil.copy2(src, dst) -> copies a file, metadata (timestamps)
	shutil.copytree(src, dst) -> recursively copies an entire directory tree
	shutil.move(src, dst) -> moves a file or directory from source to destination
	shutil.rmtree(path) -> delleets an entire directory tree 
	shutil.make_archieve(base_name, format, root_dir) -> creates a compressed archive (zip, tag)
	shutil.disk_usage(pat) -> returns disk usage statistics (total, used, free)
	shutil.unpack_archieve(filename,extract_dir) -> etracy an archieve


Exception Handling
------------------

Unit Testing:
-------------

Unit Testing in Python (unittest)

  Testing individual units or functions to ensure they work correctly.

setUp():
  Runs before each test method.
  Used to initialize variables, objects, or test environment.

tearDown():
  Runs after each test method.
  Used to clean up resources or reset state.

AAA Pattern (Arrange – Act – Assert):
  Arrange: Prepare test data and setup.
  Act: Call the function or method under test.
  Assert: Verify the result or behavior.

Common Assertions:
  assertEqual(a, b)         -> Passes if a == b
  assertNotEqual(a, b)      -> Passes if a != b
  assertTrue(x)             -> Passes if x is True
  assertFalse(x)            -> Passes if x is False
  assertIsNone(x)           -> Passes if x is None
  assertIsNotNone(x)        -> Passes if x is not None
  assertRaises(Exception)   -> Checks if code raises the expected exception

Command to run tests:
  python -m unittest discover

Options:
  -s <directory>    -> Start directory (default: current directory)
  -p <pattern>      -> Pattern to match test files (default: test*.py)
